Using radial basis function networks as the variational trial wavefunction to approximate ground states of various hamiltonians. Project for PHY456 Quantum Mechanics II. 

metropolis is the main file to run things.

The plotted function is that of the amplitudes of each pair of quantum numbers, rather than the wavefunction itself. But we will be able to plot the actual wavefunction by incrementally calculating the linear combination of amplitudes at each point in a grid (For future me to do).
